**Assignment 1**

*Part 1: Create datapath elements*


*Part 2: Latency Estimation of Datapath Component Library*
Using Xilinx Vivado, synthesize each component using different settings for the DATAWIDTH parameter,
including sizes of 2, 8, 16, 32, and 64.
Select the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (XC7A100T) as the target device.
Determine the critical path for each component for each parameter settings by viewing the synthesis
report.
Create a text file named DPCL_LAT.txt that includes a table describing the resulting critical path for
times using the following format:
ComponentName : Latency2bit Latency8bit Latency16bit Latency32bit
Latency64bit
